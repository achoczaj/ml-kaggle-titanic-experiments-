1,First Class,A Deck,A-6 or A-8 (?),"Beattie, Mr Thomson
McCaffry, Mr Thomas Francis",Peuchen\'s testimony at the Senate inquiry,"When Peuchen is asked about where his friends were, he said A-12 for Ross and ""A-8 and numbers to that affect"" for Beattie and McCaffry. This suggests that Beattie and McCaffry may have moved from C deck to be near their sick friend, occupying cabins A-8 and perhaps A-6. If Beattie and McCaffry did move to A deck, it is possible that Mr Beattie was in A-8 and McCaffry in A-6."

1,First Class,A Deck,A-11 (?),"Rosenbaum (Russell), Miss Edith Louise",Personal account (? specific source),Miss Rosenbaum booked late and does not appear on any cabin lists. She herself stated that she was in A-11.
1,First Class,A Deck,A-12 (?),"Sloper, Mr William Thompson",Speculation,"Sloper\'s cabin number is not known for certain. A-12: Given the port of embarkation and ticket office A-12 would have been permitted for the price Sloper paid. Sloper\'s account appears in the book ""The life and times of Andrew Jackson Sloper"" Which is a book he wrote about his father but seemed to consist mainly of his own memoirs. In it he claims he ""<U+0085>was going through the door when Ross called out<U+0085>"" This was most probably the door of his cabin. But even if Sloper was leaving A-12, he would have still heard Ross, since A-12 was next door to Ross\' cabin A-10. Sloper also confuses the reader in his account. In it he describes playing cards in the Lounge with Miss Gibson and others, when they leave and are ""<U+0085>standing at the top of the stairs<U+0085>"" Miss Gibson decided they should all go for a walk before retiring. Sloper then continues that he ran down one flight of stairs to his cabin. This gives an impression that he was on B deck. But there is more evidence that he was on A deck, he remembers meeting Mr Dulles (A-18)."

Mrs Bishop said ""he had a stateroom near us"". She did not say next to or across the hall. This perhaps means he was not in either B-43 or B-47. Since he was not far from them, the nearest unoccupied cabins would be B-31 or B-33. Crawford, in his testimony, mentions taking lifebelts from the top of the wardrobe in Mr Stewart\'s cabin. There was only a walk-in wardrobe in B-43 where the lifebelts would have been kept on a rack on the floor. In cabins B-31 and B-33 the lifebelts would have been kept on top of the wardrobe."

1,Second Class,E Deck,E-77 (?),"Mack, Mrs Mary",Ticket found on her body.,"Her cabin is usually given as E-77 but this was actually a first class cabin. Although E-43 onward were originally second class cabins, first class cabins were later extended all the way to E-88 probably due to the anticipated demand which did not in fact materialize. It is possible that, once the low take-up of first class cabins was realized, E-69 onward were returned to second class, in which case Mrs Mack could have occupied E-77 although this is speculation. It is equally possible that E-77 is simply a transcription error."
